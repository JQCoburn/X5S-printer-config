# X5S-printer-config
This is my printer configuration for my TronXY X5S 3D printer running Klipper.

My X5S runs Klipper firmware with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an SKR V1.3 mainboard. The SKR V1.3 is populated with TMC2209 stepsticks.

Current configuration:
* E3D V6 hotend
* Zesty Nimble V1.1 Extruder
* Sensorless homing on X & Y
* Dual Z-Axis

# Note that this is currently a Work In Progress and I'm still testing and tuning for my printer.

Thanks to Edward Niedziejko and Jens Raab for providing Klipper printer configs to get me started.
